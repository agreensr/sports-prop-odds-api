KEY VALIDATION FINDINGS
================================================================================

TIER 1 - REST DAYS (FIXED):
✅ BEFORE: Rest days were random (0-6 with random distribution)
✅ AFTER:  Rest days calculated from actual last_game_date
✅ VERIFIED: 5/5 players returned consistent values across multiple calls

TIER 2 - FATIGUE SCALING (NEW):
✅ Young players (21yo): 7% B2B penalty
✅ Prime players (30yo): 15% B2B penalty  
✅ Veteran players (38yo): 20% B2B penalty
✅ Fatigue is non-linear: 32min=100%, 36min=95%, 40min=87%, 42min=75%

TIER 3 - USAGE BOOST (NEW):
✅ Calculates based on injured teammates' usage rates
✅ Position-specific: same position = 60% boost, adjacent = 30%, different = 10%
✅ Stat-specific: guards get assist boost, bigs get rebound boost
✅ Capped at 20% maximum boost

TIER 4 - TRAVEL FATIGUE (NEW):
✅ Distance-based: <500mi=0%, 500-1000mi=-1%, 1000-1500mi=-2%, 2000+mi=-5%
✅ Timezone changes: -1% to -3% penalty
✅ Altitude teams (DEN, UTA): additional -2% penalty
✅ Home teams: 0 travel fatigue (correct)

NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Enable real odds integration (Odds API) for live bookmaker lines
2. Monitor prediction accuracy by age group to validate fatigue model
3. Run validation script weekly to ensure model stability
4. Track actual vs predicted performance for continuous improvement
